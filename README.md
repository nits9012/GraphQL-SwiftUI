# GraphQL-SwiftUI

I am using the GraphQL API provided by https://countries.trevorblades.com/ to fetch country-related data. This API allows you to query information such as country names, codes, languages, and more. It's a great resource for exploring GraphQL queries in action, as it provides an easy-to-use interface for making requests and getting responses in real-time.
